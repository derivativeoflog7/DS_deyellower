# ds_deyellow_test
Test application, **potentially** helping with the yellowed screens issue on NDS(i) consoles, by cycling the screens rapidly to blue, then yellow, then white, then black, and repeating.

# Reasoning
After noticing my DSi's screens started to yellow from the corners and sides, I tried using leaving it on for 2.5 days on a white screen.  
While that did help a bit, I was starting to get worried about leaving the console on at max brightness, so I stopped; it was also apparently reyellowing a bit after leaving it off for the night.  
But then the next day, after using the console for an afternoon to play games, I noticed that the yellowing was noticeably reduced.  
Because of this, I started thinking that changing colors would be more effective compared to a static white screen.  

# Epilepsy warning
Please take the necessary precautions, or avoid using this application yourself, if you're sensitive to rapidly flashing/cycling lights.  

# Disclaimer
There's still a lot of unknown things regarding yellow NDS(i) screens, the causes, and the processes to potentially revert it.  
This was made as a test program after the above observations I made on my console, but it's not guaranteed to work for everyone (or completely), especially for more serious cases.  
Leaving the console on for a prolonged period of time, especially at maximum brightness, can and has been known to kill screens, and will potentially reduce the lifespan of them.  
Leaving the console on and plugged to a charger for a prolonged period of time will also definitely shorten the battery's lifetime and it's capacity to hold a charge.  
Understand and accepts these risks before trying to deyellow screens, with this application or in general.  
I'm not responsible for damaged or broken displays, batteries, or other components caused by leaving this application running for long periods of time.  

# Usage
Launch the application (Unlaunch doesn't seem to work) and it will immediately start cycling.  
Hold the dpad up to temporarly show blue screens, right for yellow, down for white, and left for black.  
Hold X, and press the dpad up to decrease the speed, down to speed it back up, and left to reset it to the default.   
Hold Y, and press the dpad up to turn off the backlight, right for level 1, down for level 2, left for level 3, A for level 4, and B for level 5 ([not all backlight levels are available on all models](https://blocksds.skylyrac.net/libnds/system_8h.html#a9bd93bee5409c05451447034b250959b), some may act the same) (this is mostly for testing, it is currently not certainly known how and if the backlight impacts the process).  

# TODO
Test if this approach actually works, and create a better application akin to [3deyellower](https://github.com/ManiacOfGitHub/3Deyellower) (with menus, periodic rest times, different modes, etc.)
